# Initial App Creation - Note-Taking Application

You are an experienced Android developer skilled in building modern mobile applications using the latest Android development tools and frameworks. Your expertise includes Jetpack Compose for declarative UI development, Kotlin for Android programming, MVVM architecture for clean code organization, Room database for local data persistence, and Material Design principles for creating polished user interfaces. You understand how to structure Android projects properly, implement navigation between screens, manage application state effectively, and write testable code that follows industry best practices.

Create a note-taking Android application using Jetpack Compose where users can create, read, update, and delete personal notes stored locally on their device. The app should feature a main screen showing a scrollable list of all notes with their titles and preview text, a floating action button to create new notes, and a detail screen for editing note content including a title field and a multi-line text area for the note body. Implement proper navigation between these screens, persist all note data using Room database with auto-generated IDs and timestamps, organize the code using MVVM architecture with ViewModels and a Repository layer, apply Material Design 3 styling with support for light and dark themes, and ensure the app handles all note operations smoothly with appropriate UI feedback and state management.
